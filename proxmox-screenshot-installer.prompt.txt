Create a full GitHub repository that automates deployment and provisioning of a Proxmox VE node running on Debian 12, designed to host multiple Windows 11 GPU-enabled worker VMs for running CS2 clients.

Requirements:

1. A bash script `install_proxmox.sh` that:
   - Runs on a fresh Debian 12 server.
   - Automatically installs and configures Proxmox VE (latest stable) via official repos.
   - Installs NVIDIA drivers and applies vgpu_unlock patch to enable multiple vGPU profiles on one NVIDIA GPU (e.g., RTX 4090).
   - Creates the required vGPU profiles for N workers (configurable).
   - Downloads or creates a Windows 11 VM template with:
     - Python installed,
     - CS2 client installed,
     - A startup script that pulls a GitHub repo with CS2 launch scripts.
   - Supports input parameters:
     --workers=<number_of_workers> (default 5)
     --loadbalancerurl=<url>

2. A bash or Python provisioning script `provision_workers.sh` that:
   - Uses Proxmox API or `pvesh` CLI to clone the Windows 11 template N times.
   - Assigns each VM a unique vGPU profile.
   - Configures each VM to run a bootstrap script on first boot which:
     - Installs missing dependencies if any,
     - Pulls the CS2 GitHub package,
     - Runs `start.ps1` inside the VM,
     - Registers itself as "healthy" at the loadbalancer URL.

3. A PowerShell bootstrap script `bootstrap_worker.ps1` to be injected into the Windows 11 template VM that:
   - Runs at startup,
   - Pulls the CS2 repo from GitHub,
   - Starts CS2 client,
   - Reports health status to the loadbalancer.

4. A README.md explaining:
   - How to prepare a fresh Debian 12 host server.
   - How to run `install_proxmox.sh` with parameters.
   - How the provisioning works.
   - How to customize workers count and loadbalancer URL.
   - How to update the Windows 11 VM template.

5. Scripts should include:
   - Proper error handling and logging.
   - Idempotent operations to safely rerun without side effects.
   - Clear comments explaining the workflow.

Output:

- Full repository directory structure.
- Main scripts with in-line comments and explanations.

Make sure the repo provides a production-ready, fully automated Proxmox + Windows 11 worker cluster deployment solution optimized for GPU sharing via vgpu_unlock and CS2 workload.
